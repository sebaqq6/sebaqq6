## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

As I mentioned, I've recently started focusing on **Java** and I'm really enjoying the journey. My goal is to deepen my expertise in this language and work on more complex projects. I'm also continuously improving my skills in other areas, particularly in full-stack web development.

## ðŸ’¬ About Me

I genuinely enjoy programming and solving problems through code. I'm always eager to learn new things and take on challenges that push me out of my comfort zone. If you have any advice, resources, or just want to chat about coding, feel free to reach out!
